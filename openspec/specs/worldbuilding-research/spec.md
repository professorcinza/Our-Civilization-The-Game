# Worldbuilding Research Specification

## Purpose

A research program of reverse engineering the mechanics of reference games (Albion Online, GTA San Andreas, GTA V RP worldwide, MUDs, CyberCode Online, racing simulators — iRacing, Assetto Corsa Competizione, BeamNG.drive — world simulators — Microsoft Flight Simulator, DCS World — and military/tactical and survival simulators — Arma 3, Escape from Tarkov, Ready or Not, SCUM, Project Zomboid) and a playable prototype of the final engine built on d3wasm (Doom 3 / id Tech 4 ported to WebAssembly+WebGL, GPL-3.0), with the goal of extracting verifiable world-building lessons that feed the Project Lunar specs for world-simulation, npc-minds, plot-generation, scenario-authoring, combat-system, memory-system, narrative-engine and mmo-game. Everything in English; structural headings and SHALL/MUST keywords in English.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Reverse Engineering of Albion Online Mechanics

### Requirement: Reverse Engineering of Red Dead Redemption Mechanics

The research system SHALL document, from public sources (RDR2/RDR1 official documentation, Rockstar design interviews, community analysis), the mechanics that keep RDR2 ahead of most 2026 releases as systemic density: world-as-simulation (NPC routines, predator chains, decaying carcasses, mud/snow affecting movement), horse bonding (bond levels, permanent death, carrying the inventory), the honor system that changes prices/dialogues/endings without a visible moral meter, hunting with real rules (wrong caliber ruins the pelt, clean shot preserves value, abandoned carcass attracts predators), crime with witnesses (regional bounty, mask-mediated identity), contextual dialogue with NPC memory, the living body (weight, beard, dirt changing treatment), and Dead Eye target marking as a tactical tool; plus RDR1's random road events, iconic duels and Euphoria reactions — and what aged badly (heavy controls, slow menus, sprawled tutorials) recorded as design guardrails.

Each mechanic SHALL generate a lesson card in the same format as the other tracks.

#### Scenario: Narrated-Ledger Lesson

### Requirement: Reverse Engineering of World-Simulator Fidelity Mechanics

The research system SHALL document, from public sources (Microsoft Flight Simulator and DCS World official documentation, developer communications, module-maker materials), the mechanics that make these simulators reference world-simulators: MSFS's whole-world substrate (the entire planet pre-exists at generated fidelity — photogrammetry where attention flows, autogen elsewhere — with authored content raising fidelity locally, like hand-crafted airports), real-time reality injection (live weather from real-world data), licensed aircraft (authenticity through partnership and provenance); and DCS World's study-level cockpit simulation (every button and system modeled and operable, teaching the real machine through operation), multi-crew stations (divided roles operating one complex system, e.g. pilot + RIO), the mission editor as a creation platform, and the third-party module ecosystem with a maintained quality bar. Each mechanic SHALL generate a lesson card in the same format as the other tracks.

### Requirement: Reverse Engineering of Racing Simulation Fidelity Mechanics

The research system SHALL document, from public sources (iRacing and Assetto Corsa Competizione official documentation and community telemetry guides; BeamNG.drive documentation of its soft-body node-beam model), the mechanics that make professional drivers train on these simulators: tire thermal/degradation models (grip as a temperature and wear curve, not a state), the friction circle (finite total grip shared between competing demands), weight transfer (load shifts under braking/cornering; direction changes require preparation), aerodynamic context sensitivity (downforce rising with speed, dirty air degrading following cars), telemetry-driven deliberate practice loops (lap data exported and analyzed), iRacing's safety rating and licensing (conduct measured per incident, progressive access), and BeamNG's soft-body deformation (vehicles as node-beam structures where crash damage is continuous, structural and functionally emergent — never a pre-baked damage state). Each mechanic SHALL generate a lesson card in the same format as the other tracks.

#### Scenario: Training-Transfer Lesson

- **WHEN** the research documents professionals training on the simulator because skills transfer to reality
- **THEN** the card SHALL propose transfer-of-training as a measurable simulation-quality bar for the game's training domains (mmo-game) or a justified discard

- **THEN** the card SHALL cite the public source (URL) and verification date

### Requirement: Albion-in-Life-RP Hybrid Synthesis

The research system SHALL document the cross-game synthesis of Albion Online systems transposed onto a real-life RP world (GTA San Andreas/RP style): risk bands reinterpreted as state presence per region (financial district = Blue with cameras and fast response; industrial/port = Yellow; periphery = Red; no-signal rural zones = Black with no reliable map/info), full loot domesticated as carry-only material loss, regional markets per neighborhood, guild territory reinterpreted as faction-controlled districts with protection/commerce income, seasons as elected government terms, spec-by-use as practice-based skill, and inter-city logistics as freight routes with ambush risk. The synthesis SHALL surface what each side fixes: Albion's closed economy solves RP inflation; RP's sacred character life domesticates Albion's cheap death; player institutions legalize scheduled territory wars.

#### Scenario: Hybrid Translation Cards

- **WHEN** the synthesis is documented
- **THEN** lesson cards SHALL exist for the three novel translations: closed economy with faucets/sinks (mmo-game), carry-only material consequence (mmo-game), and declared territory wars via player-run institutions (mmo-game)

### Requirement: Reverse Engineering of GTA V RP Worldwide Mechanics

The research system SHALL document, from public sources (server sites and wikis: nopixel.net, cidadealta.gg, gta5rp.com, gta.world; platform browsers: rage.mp/servers, forge.plebmasters.de), the mechanics of the worldwide GTA V roleplay ecosystem (private RP cities on FiveM in the West/Brazil, RAGE MP in Russia/CIS): whitelist/allowlist gates (application, interview, paid tiers), the IC/OOC rule set (RDM/VDM, metagaming, powergaming, New Life Rule), player-run institutions (police, EMS, lawyer, judge, press), player-driven economies and gangs/factions, staff arbitration with seasonal storytelling arcs, and the per-country differentiation (NoPixel's story-first streamer culture, Brazil's streamer-founded cities with paid convenience tiers, Russia's voice-integrated massive servers, GTA World's strict text RP with 1M+ registered players). Each mechanic SHALL generate a lesson card in the same format as the other tracks, with candidate translations mapped where applicable to mmo-game.

#### Scenario: Cultural Shard Lesson

- **WHEN** the research documents per-country/per-community server differentiation (same world, different rules, tone and language)
- **THEN** the card SHALL propose a translation to cultural/regional shards over one uniform world (mmo-game) or a justified discard

#### Scenario: Player Institutions Lesson

- **WHEN** the research documents player-run institutions (police, EMS, press) as world state operators
- **THEN** the card SHALL evaluate institutional roles occupied by players with persisted minds (player-minds) instead of NPCs (mmo-game/npc-minds)

#### Scenario: New Life Rule Maps to Witness Filter

- **WHEN** the research documents the New Life Rule (dead characters forget the events of their previous death)
- **THEN** the card SHALL record the convergence with the engine's witness filter and memory pyramid, and what the RP implementation teaches

#### Scenario: Verifiable Source

- **WHEN** a lesson card claims a mechanic about a specific server or country scene
- **THEN** the card SHALL cite the public source (URL) and verification date

### Requirement: d3wasm-Based Prototype of the Final Engine for World-Building

The project SHALL include a playable in-browser prototype built on **d3wasm** (github.com/gabrielcuvillier/d3wasm — the id Tech 4 / Doom 3 engine ported to WebAssembly via Emscripten with a full WebGL renderer backend, GPL-3.0) as the prototype of the game's final engine. The prototype serves as a world-building laboratory — dark corridors, dynamic flashlights, shadows, interactive lore terminals, positional audio, and script triggers — where every level design element SHALL teach a lesson mappable to the narrative engine (e.g., terminal with lore ≈ story card; script trigger ≈ plot seed; lighting that guides ≈ narrative emphasis). Studying and extending the d3wasm codebase (`neo/` engine sources) SHALL also produce engine-architecture lesson cards (renderer, asset pipeline, scripting, GUI/terminal systems) informing the final engine decision.

#### Scenario: The Prototype Loads in the Browser

- **WHEN** the prototype is opened in a modern browser (no native build, no plugins)
- **THEN** it SHALL render a first-person 3D scene with dynamic lighting at 30+ FPS on common hardware, running on the d3wasm WebAssembly/WebGL engine

#### Scenario: Interaction with Lore

- **WHEN** the player interacts with a prototype terminal
- **THEN** the displayed lore text SHALL be mapped to a world-building lesson card

#### Scenario: Engine Architecture Lessons

- **WHEN** the d3wasm codebase (id Tech 4 subsystems: scripting, GUI, asset pipeline, renderer) is studied
- **THEN** lesson cards SHALL capture which architectural decisions apply to the final engine of a narrative RPG (or a justified discard)

#### Scenario: GPL Boundary Is Respected

- **WHEN** the prototype incorporates d3wasm engine code (GPL-3.0)
- **THEN** the prototype's own code SHALL be licensed GPL-3.0-compatible
- **AND** no original Doom 3 game assets (maps, textures, models, sounds, `.pk4` content) SHALL enter the repository — original or freely licensed assets only
- **AND** the trade-off that a final engine derived from d3wasm inherits GPL-3.0 copyleft SHALL be documented before adoption

### Requirement: Versioned Lesson Cards

Lessons from the tracks (Albion, GTA SA, GTA V RP, MUDs, CyberCode, racing sims, world sims, tactical/survival sims, Doom 3) SHALL be persisted in a versioned dataset (`data/worldbuilding/lessons.json`) with fields: source game, mechanic, evidence/source, candidate translation, status (proposed/accepted/discarded), and target spec. Accepted cards SHALL reference the target spec requirement that absorbs the lesson.

#### Scenario: Traceable Accepted Card

- **WHEN** a card is marked as accepted
- **THEN** a reference to the target spec and requirement that incorporated it SHALL exist
- **AND** the dataset SHALL be loadable without network dependency

### Requirement: No Asset Violations

The research program SHALL use only documentary observation of mechanics (public sources) and original implementation in the prototype; no asset, code, model, texture, or audio extracted from the reference games SHALL enter the repository. The single licensed-code exception is the d3wasm engine itself (GPL-3.0, documented), used as the prototype's engine base; game assets remain original or free with a documented permissive license — the GPL-3.0 of the engine code does not extend to using proprietary game data.

#### Scenario: Asset Audit

- **WHEN** the prototype includes a model or texture
- **THEN** the provenance/license SHALL be documented in the repository
